# Steps to run: #

1. npm install
2. npm start

This will open two command prompt windows. One running the react app and the
other running the express server.

Nodemon is installed as a dev dependence, so no need to manually install it.

Then localhost:3000/ will take you to the home page.

localhost:3000/api/version will fetch the version number from the express api.
